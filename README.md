# BeachBot
The endless flow of trash to public beaches is compromising the health of marine animals. One piece of trash wonâ€™t turn into a worldwide disaster, but when left untouched, trash starts to pile up, which then creates a major threat against marine life which can lead to life-long injuries or even death. Our robot, Beach Bot, is a robot that travels the beaches autonomously and picks up trash using a scooper. It will filter out sand using a mesh bottom so we only collect the trash.
